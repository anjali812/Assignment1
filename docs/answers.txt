b) 9 commits have been made. I used the command git log.

c) Wed Sept 27 16:31:42 2017. The command I used is git log --name-status .gitignore

e) Make sure your code changes are verified before delivering them to other developers and better support for developers working in parallel.

f) Difference between git log and git status is that git log shows the information about the latest commits while git status shows the working tree
   status.

g) git log Weapon.h

h) git log --grep="file"

i) Inheritance is when many classes have similiar attributes and they share certain information and behavior so in this case
   it is wise to have a base class and then have derived classes that inherit those similiar attributes from the base class.
   Polymorphism is when the derived classes can have functions of their own that was not inherited from the base class.
   Encapsulation is when the variables of a certain class can not be accessed by other classes and only accessed within that certain class.

7. The game is using polymorphism the Weapon class is the base class and six other classes are derived from that class and have the word
   virtual and implement the base class function. Also, the objects are pointers to the Base class which further proves that the class is a base class.
   The game is using encapsulation because for the CrazyRandomSword class, there is a private method called randpoint which is only accesible by that class
   and nowhere else. This makes it an example of encapsulation.
